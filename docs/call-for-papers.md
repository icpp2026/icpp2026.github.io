## ICPP 2026 Call for Papers

ICPP, the International Conference on Parallel Processing, provides a forum for researchers, scientists, and practitioners in academia, industry, and government to present their latest research findings in all aspects of parallel and distributed computing. ICPP is one of the oldest continuously running international computer science conferences. ICPP 2026 is the 55th edition of ICPP.

ICPP 2026 will be held in Singapore from **28 September to 1 October, 2026**. ICPP 2026 is a premier venue for presenting the latest research on all aspects of the field. ICPP 2026 will be organized around seven tracks which includes Algorithms, Applications, Architecture, Multidisciplinary, Performance, Software, and Quantum Computing. Topics of interest in ICPP 2026 papers include, but are not limited to:

1. **Algorithms:** Parallel and Distributed Algorithms, Parallel and Distributed Combinatorial & Numerical Methods, Scheduling Algorithms for Parallel and Distributed Applications and Platforms, Algorithmic Innovations for Parallel and Distributed Machine Learning.

2. **Applications:** Parallel and Distributed Applications, Scalable Data Analytics & Applied Machine Learning, Computational and Data-Driven Science & Engineering (including, but not limited to Astrophysics, Computational Chemistry and Physics, Life Science, Climate Science, Earth Science, Materials Science, Finance, Geology and Engineering).

3. **Architecture:** Micro-Architecture for Parallel Computing, Parallel Computer Architecture and Accelerator Designs, Large-Scale System Architectures, Datacenter/Warehouse Computing Architecture, Machine Learning Architectures, Architectural Support for Networking, New Memory and Storage Technologies, Near-Memory Computing, Parallel I/O, Architectures for Edge Computing, Architectural Support for Reliability and Security.

4. **Multidisciplinary:** Innovation combining multiple disciplines, Converged HPC Cloud Edge Computing, Cross-Cutting Research (e.g., Complex Workﬂows Combining Data Analytics and/or AI/ML with Traditional Simulations), Use of Known Algorithms in Novel/Emerging Applications, Methodologies for Performance Portability and/or Productivity across Architectures.

5. **Performance:** Performance Modeling of Parallel or Distributed Computing, Performance Evaluation of Parallel or Distributed Systems; Scalability, Simulation Models, Analytical Models, Measurement-Based Evaluation.

6. **Software:** Systems Software, Middleware, Runtime Systems, Parallel and Distributed Programming Languages & Models, Programming Systems, Compilers, Libraries, Programming Infrastructures and Tools, Operating and Real-Time Systems, Parallel File Systems, Data Management Systems.

7. **Quantum Computing:** Parallel Simulators of Quantum Computers, Use of Parallel Computing for Quantum Compilation and Optimization, Co-design of Parallel- and Quantum-Computing Applications, Hybrid Parallel/Quantum Software-Development Tools.

### Submission Guidelines

Paper submissions should not exceed 10 pages (including references) and all submissions must be made electronically through the conference submission portal in PDF format printable on US letter size (8.5″ x 11″) paper. Please use the ACM format located at [here](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). More speciﬁcally, we recommend using `\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}` conﬁguration for submissions prepared in LaTex. Changes to the template (e.g., margin, font size) could lead to automatic rejection. Up to two additional pages may be subsequently purchased (if needed) for the camera-ready version. Submissions should represent original research results and cannot already be under review or accepted for publication in another venue.

The review process is double-anonymous, so submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors. Authors should leave out author names, aﬃliations, and (any) acknowledgment from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of this process is to help the Program Committee and external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Authors with further questions about double-anonymous reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chairs by email.

All accepted papers that are presented at the conference will be published in the ACM Digital Library. Accepted papers will also need to follow the conference registration policy to be included in the conference proceedings. We will oﬀer rejected papers an opportunity to be forwarded to workshop organizers to be considered in one of the workshops if the authors choose to do so.

### Important Deadlines (AOE)

- Abstract Submission: April 24, 2026
- Paper Submission: May 1, 2026
- Author Notiﬁcation: June 30, 2026
- Camera-ready Paper Submission: July 30, 2026
- Conference: September 28 – October 1, 2026

### Please Note

1. We expect at least one author of an accepted paper to attend the conference. The expectation of attendance is implicit in submitting a paper to a conference, rather than a journal, and brings ethical responsibilities to participate actively in the conference (talking to other attendees, presenting the paper, and attending conference sessions).

2. Consequently, it is expected that all accepted papers will be presented in person, unless clear and extenuating circumstances prevent attendance.

3. As an author of an accepted paper, this means you should exhaust all efforts for at least one of you to attend, including seeking a visa (where needed).

4. Any allowance for remote presentation will be considered only after clear evidence that attendance is impossible.

5. These decisions about remote presentation will be made two weeks before the conference begins.

6. The conference proceedings will be finalized after the conference based on the papers presented.

7. A registration fee is required for all accepted papers, regardless of attendance.

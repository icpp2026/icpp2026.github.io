## ICPP 2026 Call for Posters

ICPP 2026 invites poster submissions presenting early-stage research, novel ideas, work-in-progress results, and late-breaking developments in parallel processing and related areas. The poster session provides an interactive forum to exchange ideas, receive feedback, and connect with the ICPP community.

### Important Dates

* **Poster submission deadline:** **June 15, 2026**  
* **Poster author notification:** **July 15, 2026**

### Poster Submission Guidelines

* **Submission type:** 1\) an Extended Abstract and 2\) a Poster Draft. The extended abstract will be included in the Workshop proceedings if accepted.  
* **Requirement:** The poster abstract **should not exceed 2 pages (including references)** and all submissions must be made electronically through the conference submission portal ([https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/icpp](https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/icpp)) in PDF format printable on US letter size (8.5″ x 11″) paper. Please use the ACM format located at: [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template.](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template.) We recommend using \\documentclass\[sigconf,review\]{acmart} conﬁguration for submissions prepared in LaTeX. Changes to the template (e.g., margin, font size) could lead to automatic rejection. Submissions should represent original research results and cannot already be under review or accepted for publication/presentation in another venue.

## ICPP 2026 Call for Demonstrations

### Scope and Goal

The ICPP 2026 Demonstration Track provides a unique opportunity for researchers and practitioners to present live demonstrations of their software, hardware, or hybrid systems. This track allows authors to showcase the interactive and tangible aspects of their contributions and engage directly with the community.

**Please note:** This is a distinct track with a separate call for submissions. Regular research papers submitted to the main conference will **not** be automatically converted to demos; authors wishing to demonstrate their work must submit to this track specifically.

### Topics of Interest

The scope of the demo track aligns with the main ICPP 2026 conference topics. We invite submissions covering all aspects of parallel and distributed computing, including but not limited to Algorithms, Applications, Architecture, Multidisciplinary, Performance, Software, and Quantum Computing. Please refer to [Call for Papers](call-for-papers.md){:target="\_blank"} for the detailed topics.

### Submission Guidelines

Proposals must be submitted via [Linklings](https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/icpp/){:target="\_blank"}. A valid submission consists of a **Demo Paper** intended for peer review.

#### 1. Demo Paper

Authors must submit a paper (maximum 4 pages) describing their intended demonstration. The paper should include:

- **Motivation:** The problem and its relevance to parallel processing.
- **System Overview:** The architecture and key technologies used.
- **Demonstration Plan:** A detailed description of what will be shown during the live demo and how the audience will interact with it.
- _Optional but Recommended:_ A link to a short video or online repository to aid the review process.

#### 2. Presentation Format (Post-Acceptance)

If accepted, authors will be required to present their demo live at the conference.

- **Poster:** Accepted demos must upload a poster before the conference presentation. 
    
    *Note: The poster itself will not be reviewed; it is intended to facilitate the presentation.*

- **Presentation:** Demonstrators are required to present the paper at the conference.
